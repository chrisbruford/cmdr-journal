/**
 * When written: when converting a pre-2.4 engineered module
 * 
 * This is generated when converting, or previewing a conversion of a legacy 
 * module to the new system. Due to the nature of the changes made for 3.0, 
 * modules generated in the old system are not compatible with the new 
 * crafting system, so players will be unable to craft with them. However, 
 * players will be given the opportunity to convert their legacy modules to 
 * the new format with the caveat that converted modules will be a recipe 
 * level below what they were before the conversion. The 
 * EngineerLegacyConvert journal entry is generated when converting a recipe, 
 * or just previewing a conversion, so some of our creative third party 
 * developers out there may be able to make tools to show how a ship loadout 
 * compares before and after converting their modules. The entry itself is the 
 * same as the EngineerCraft entry, minus the ingredients data (since no 
 * materials are required to convert), but plus an "IsPreview" bool to indicate 
 * whether this entry has been generated from a conversion, or just a preview.
